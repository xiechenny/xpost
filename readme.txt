It's a tool written in shell script written by myself.
The script will format text file into html and automatically add header / footer as setted.

Edit content_template to fill in new post,
and run ./xpost.sh to produce html page,  see usage picture for detail

the content automatically translates:
/b text b/ : to be bolder
/i text i/ : to be italic
/u text u/ : to decorate as underline
/t to padding 4 space
and, support <pre></pre> tags to be not translated.
